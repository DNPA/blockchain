# blockchain fork

This is a fork of https://code.google.com/p/blockchain/

Currently the fork has been made to compile with a set of additional compiler 
flags and is functionaly identical to the original.

We plan to use this patched fork as basis for a tool that dumps the blockchain 
in an ArangoDB friendly format.
